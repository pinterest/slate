# Slate
Slate is a framework that solves Resource Lifecycle Management enabling us to create a unified Platform as a Service for infrastructure. It enables pluggable
implementation of platform resource types while providing a common interface (UI / API) that allows clients to declaratively create infrastructure.

Slate can be used for creating infra as code management layer for any multi-service platform environment.
